# Connector for Xiaomi Mi Scale

## Body Composition Scale 2 (XMTZC05HM) Data to MQTT / Influxdb
Code to read weight measurements from Xiaomi Body Scales.

## Prerequisites

An MQTT broker is needed as the counterpart for this daemon. Even though an MQTT-less mode is provided, it is not recommended for normal smart home automation integration. MQTT is huge help in connecting different parts of your smart home and setting up of a broker is quick and easy.



## Installation

On a modern Linux system just a few steps are needed to get the daemon working. The following example shows the installation under Debian/Raspbian below the `/opt` directory:



```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/zibous/ha-miscale.git /opt/ha-miscale
$ cd /opt/ha-miscale
$ sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```

To match personal needs, all operation details can be configured using the file **config.py** The file needs to be created first:

```bash
$ cd /opt/ha-miscale
$ cp conf.py.dist conf.py
$ nano conf.py

$ chmod +x app.py
$ chmod +x mqttservice.py

## tests
$ python3 app.py
$ ./app.py

$ python3 mqttservice.py
$ ./mqttservice.py
```



## Application for Raspberry / Linux computer

Read [Xiaomi Mi Body Composition Scale](https://www.mi.com/global/mi-body-composition-scale) data from a Raspberry Pi in Python 3.

`python3 app.py`

### Execution

## MQTT service for ESP32 Devices
A simple Python script which provides a MQTT gateway for ESP Devices, easily extensible via custom workers. Application for ESP Devices see:

https://github.com/1technophile/OpenMQTTGateway

### Execution
`python3 mqttservice.py`

## Configuration

You most probably want to execute the program **continuously in the background**. This can be done either by using the internal daemon or cron.

**Attention:** Daemon mode must be enabled in the configuration file (default).

1. Systemd service - on systemd powered systems the **recommended** option

   ```bash
   sudo cp /opt/ha-miscale/service_app.template /etc/systemd/system/ha-miscale.service
   
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl start ha-miscale.service
   sudo systemctl status ha-miscale.service
   
   sudo systemctl enable ha-miscale.service
   ```
